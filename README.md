# SQL-Project
Title: Supermarket Sales Analysis with SQL

Introduction:
The purpose of this project is to analyze the historical sales data of a supermarket company using SQL queries. The dataset includes sales records of three branches for three months. The data contains various attributes such as invoice ID, branch, city, customer type, gender, product line, unit price, quantity, tax, total, date, time, payment method, cost of goods sold, gross margin percentage, gross income, and customer rating. The main objective of this project is to gain insights into the sales data and to understand the purchasing behavior of customers.

Skills learned:
During this project, we have used several SQL commands, including SELECT, WHERE, DISTINCT, FROM, COUNT, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and ALIAS. These commands helped us to retrieve and analyze the data in different ways, as per our requirements. We have also learned how to use the WHERE clause to filter data based on certain conditions and how to use the GROUP BY clause to group data based on a particular attribute. The ORDER BY clause helped us to sort the data in ascending or descending order.


The project code and dataset can be found in the Found above . The repository includes a README file that provides information about the project and the SQL commands used for analysis.


Finally In this project, I have analyzed the sales data of a supermarket company using SQL queries. We have gained insights into the purchasing behavior of customers and identified the top-selling products and branches. This analysis can help the company to make data-driven decisions and improve their sales strategies. The project code and dataset are available in the Github repository, and it can be used as a reference for similar data analysis projects.


SQL Keywords Learned :

SELECT:
The SELECT keyword is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. It specifies the columns that should be retrieved, and it can also include expressions, functions, and aliases. The syntax is SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name.

WHERE:
The WHERE keyword is used to filter data based on one or more conditions. It specifies a Boolean expression that evaluates to true or false, and only the rows that satisfy the condition are included in the result set. The syntax is WHERE condition.

DISTINCT:
The DISTINCT keyword is used to retrieve unique values from a column in a table. It eliminates duplicates from the result set and returns only the distinct values. The syntax is SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name.

FROM:
The FROM keyword is used to specify the table or tables from which data should be retrieved. It identifies the source of the data and is used in conjunction with the SELECT keyword. The syntax is SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name.

COUNT:
The COUNT keyword is used to count the number of rows in a table or the number of values in a column. It returns a single value that represents the count. The syntax is SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name.

GROUP BY:
The GROUP BY keyword is used to group data based on one or more columns in a table. It creates groups of rows that have the same values in the specified columns, and it can be used with aggregate functions such as COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc. The syntax is SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name GROUP BY column1, column2, ....

ORDER BY:
The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result set in ascending or descending order based on one or more columns. It specifies the column or columns that should be used for sorting, and it can also include the ASC or DESC keyword to specify the sort order. The syntax is SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name ORDER BY column1 ASC/DESC, column2 ASC/DESC, ....

ALIAS:
The ALIAS keyword is used to give a table or column a temporary name in a SQL query. It provides a shorthand notation for referring to tables and columns in complex queries and can also be used to rename columns in the result set. The syntax is SELECT column_name AS alias_name FROM table_name.
