# SQL-Project
Title: Supermarket Sales Analysis with SQL

Introduction:
The purpose of this project is to analyze the historical sales data of a supermarket company using SQL queries. The dataset includes sales records of three branches for three months. The data contains various attributes such as invoice ID, branch, city, customer type, gender, product line, unit price, quantity, tax, total, date, time, payment method, cost of goods sold, gross margin percentage, gross income, and customer rating. The main objective of this project is to gain insights into the sales data and to understand the purchasing behavior of customers.

Skills learned:
During this project, we have used several SQL commands, including SELECT, WHERE, DISTINCT, FROM, COUNT, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and ALIAS. These commands helped us to retrieve and analyze the data in different ways, as per our requirements. We have also learned how to use the WHERE clause to filter data based on certain conditions and how to use the GROUP BY clause to group data based on a particular attribute. The ORDER BY clause helped us to sort the data in ascending or descending order.


The project code and dataset can be found in the Found above . The repository includes a README file that provides information about the project and the SQL commands used for analysis.


Finally In this project, I have analyzed the sales data of a supermarket company using SQL queries. We have gained insights into the purchasing behavior of customers and identified the top-selling products and branches. This analysis can help the company to make data-driven decisions and improve their sales strategies. The project code and dataset are available in the Github repository, and it can be used as a reference for similar data analysis projects.
